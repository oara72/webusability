            <h2>Battlefield Hardline Review</h2>
			<h5>by Jeff Gerstmann on March 17, 2015</h5>
			<hr>
			<strong>Battlefield Hardline did not crash during our tests and appears to function precisely as expected at this time.  </strong>

			<p>Do you want to play more Battlefield-style multiplayer, with some new modes and an ever-so-slight spin on said multiplayer's scale 
			and weaponry? That's the question you need to ask if you're considering a purchase of Battlefield Hardline. It seems to be functional 
			(which is more than you could say about its predecessor when it launched in 2013), and it plays like a Battlefield game, generally 
			speaking. Either that's something you're interested in paying full price for or, for whatever reason, you aren't. The other parts 
			of Battlefield Hardline aren't interesting enough to further justify the purchase, so I probably wouldn't take the single-player 
			campaign into account too heavily if you're on the fence.</p>

			<p>Or, to put it another way, you probably already know whether you're going to buy Battlefield Hardline or not.</p>

			<p>To separate a bit from the crowd of people who are already either firmly in or out of Camp Battlefield, let's talk a bit about 
			those modes and tweaks. Battlefield Hardline is about cops and criminals instead of the military and "opposing forces." So the scale 
			of the conflicts you see in the multiplayer mode are... somewhat smaller. Or, at least, you can't spawn with a rocket launcher. 
			Instead you just have to miraculously find a rocket launcher out in the environment. And you aren't flying jets around all 
			crazy-like... but yeah, there are still helicopters. It's a somewhat minor change, which is kind of ridiculous (or, 
			depending on your viewpoint, quite worrying) when you think about the scope of most police operations.</p>
